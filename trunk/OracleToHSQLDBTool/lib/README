The lib directory (as checked out from the repository) should contain:

ant-1.6.5.jar           for schemamule Ant tasks
cglib-full-2.0.2.jar    hibernate2 dependency
commons-logging.jar     hibernate2 dependency
hibernate2-2.1.8.jar    for Hibernate Dialect class
hsqldb-1.8.0.4.jar      for HSQLDB dialect
spring-beans-1.2.8.jar  dependency of other Spring jars
spring-core-1.2.8.jar   dependency of other Spring jars
spring-dao-1.2.8.jar    for some exceptions thrown by classes used from spring-jdbc*.jar
spring-jdbc-1.2.8.jar   so we can access databases

If it's easier for you, in your deployment environment please go ahead and replace the spring-* jars with the full spring.jar. That's what we do, but on our projects we use Spring for other things as well.

Note: to run the tests and/or use Oracle features, you must put a recent version of Oracle's JDBC driver software (i.e. ojdbc14.jar; classes12.jar might work but we haven't tried it) on the classpath. You can download the Oracle JDBC driver jar from http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html
